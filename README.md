# UiCodingChallenge

## About
This app was built in a weekend by Rachel Cavin as part of a prescribed coding challenge. It uses Angular 6, RxJS, D3, and Angular Material as core dependencies. The purpose of this app is to visualize data input by app users in bar charts, bubble charts, and scatter plots. I hope you like it!

## Quick Note
This app is deployed on github pages - [Check it out here!](https://rmcavin.github.io/ui-coding-challenge/data)

I added a documentation generator called compodoc to this project to give a high-level overview of what I've built. It shows all modules, components, etc and any JSDOC Annotations I wrote to accompany them. You can view it by running `npm run docs`.

## CLI Output

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
